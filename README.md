# Vagrant task

## Working with Virtual Machine, Virtualbox and Vagrant


## VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM)

A Virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. It can run in a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different operating system—or even to function as the user's entire computer experience—as is common on many people's work computers.


## VIRTUALBOX
                                
VirtualBox is cross-platform virtualization software. It allows users to extend their existing computer to run multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris, at the same time.


## VAGRANT 

Vagrant is the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. Isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable and consistent environment. it is free, reliable and well maintained

VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine provider. The virtual machines themselves will be spawned using VirtualBox. VirtualBox is free and lightweight, which make it a perfect choice. Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider. 

The purpose of this vagrant task is to allow us to be able to code and to do ALX Assessment on our local computer, and having a virtual machine is the perfect tool.
